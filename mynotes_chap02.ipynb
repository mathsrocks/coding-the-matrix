After we have learned what it means for vectors to be close, it will be straightforward to solve this computational problem.\n",

In Chapter 10, he explores some compression schemes based on the idea.\n",

Low-rank matrices arise in analysing data to discover factors that explain the data. He considers a computational problem in which the goal, given a matrix and a parameter $k$, is to find the closest matrix whose rank is at most $k$. We show that linear algebra provides a solution for this computational problem. It is at the heart of a widely used method called _principal component analysis_, and we will explore some of its applications."

    "We saw in Chapter 1 that _scaling_ could be represented in the complex plane by a function $f(z) = rz$ that multiplies its complex-number input by a positive real number $r$, and that multiplying by a negative number achieves a simultaneous scaling and rotation by 180 degrees. The analogous operation for vectors is called _scalar-vector multiplication_. In the context of vectors, a _field element_ (e.g. a number) is called a _scalar_ because it can be used to _scale_ a vector via multiplication. In this book, the author typically uses Greek letters (e.g. $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$) to denote scalars."
